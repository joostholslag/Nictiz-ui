 * Deciding who a request is from.
 *

 * that decides whether a request is served at all, and getting it wrong in
 * either direction is costly — too strict and the app is unreachable, too loose
 * and the CDR is open.
 *
 * What this module does NOT do is authenticate. Credentials are verified at the
 * edge — oauth2-proxy answers the ingress's auth-url subrequest after a
 * Keycloak login (or a valid Bearer JWT), and the ingress forwards the verified
 * identity as X-Auth-Request-User / X-Auth-Request-Email. Everything here READS
 * that already-verified identity. Re-checking the credential would mean this
 * service talking OIDC itself, which is precisely the coupling the edge proxy
 * exists to avoid.
